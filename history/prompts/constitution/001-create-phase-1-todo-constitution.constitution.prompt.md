## Prompt

# Phase I Todo Application – Constitution

## Purpose
This project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD). The objective of Phase I is
to build a simple, reliable, in-memory Todo application that runs in the
command-line interface (CLI).

All development decisions must be guided by this constitution and the approved
specification. No implementation may begin until the specification, plan, and
tasks are agreed upon.

## Core Principles
1. Specification before implementation.
2. Planning before coding.
3. Tasks before execution.
4. Simplicity over complexity.
5. No features beyond Phase I scope.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- No manual coding by a human.
- All code must be generated by Claude Code.
- No feature additions beyond the approved specification.
- No database, file system, or persistent storage.
- No web interface or GUI.

## Technical Constraints
- Programming Language: Python 3.13 or higher
- Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Storage: In-memory only using Python data structures
- Libraries: Python standard library only
- Architecture: Clear separation of concerns

## Task Entity Rules
Each Todo task must contain:
- id: Integer, auto-incremented and unique
- title: String, required
- description: String, optional
- completed: Boolean, default is false

## CLI Behavior Rules
- Menu-driven interaction using numbered options
- Clear and readable prompts
- Graceful handling of invalid input
- Continuous loop until user explicitly exits

## Quality Standards
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Small, focused functions
- Predictable behavior
- No dead or unused code

## Response snapshot

Created Phase I Todo Application Constitution (version 1.0.0) with 5 core principles:

1. Specification Before Implementation - No coding without approved spec
2. Planning Before Coding - No coding without approved architectural plan
3. Tasks Before Execution - All work broken into discrete, testable tasks
4. Simplicity Over Complexity - Use Python standard library only, no over-engineering
5. No Features Beyond Phase I Scope - Strictly scoped to Phase I requirements

Technical constraints established: Python 3.13+, CLI only, in-memory storage, standard library only, clear separation of concerns.

Task entity schema defined: id (auto-increment), title (required), description (optional), completed (boolean).

CLI behavior rules defined: menu-driven, numbered options, input validation, continuous loop, user feedback.

All template files (.specify/templates/plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md) reviewed and confirmed compatible with constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational constitution (v1.0.0) governing all Phase I development
- 🧪 Tests: None (constitution document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create feature specification for Todo application
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully translates user requirements into formal SDD governance structure with clear principles, constraints, and quality standards

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (initial constitution creation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
